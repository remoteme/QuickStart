    <li>PWM input for drive motors Should be connected to PWM module 15’th and 16th pins</li>
    <li>Power input for drive motors (check what maximum voltage your motors can work with)</li>
    <li>Power for RaspberryPi and PWM module – have to be exactly 5V</li>
    <li>Drive motor outputs (there are two outputs because we will pair drive motors )</li>
    <li>Servo Mechanisms power – also You have to check what voltage is good for them</li>
    <li>Jumper its present power from 5th input will power also drive motors so no need to connect anything to input 2</li>
    <li>Jumper if present RaspberryPi will be power from 3rd input – before put jumper here check if connections are OK – You don’t want to burn your RPi</li>
    <li>Lets solder here cables since we don’t need logic converters</li>
