<ol start="1">
    <li>PWM input for motor driver should be connected to PWM module 15th and 16th pins</li>
    <li>Power input for motor driver (check what maximum voltage your motors can work with)</li>
    <li>Power for RasbperryPi and PWM module – must be exactly 5V</li>
    <li>Motor driver outputs (there are two outputs because we will pair the motors)</li>
    <li>Servo Mechanisms power – also you have to check what voltage is good for your servos (refer the datasheet)</li>
    <li>Jumper if present power from 5th input will also power motor drive so no need to connect anything to input 2</li>
    <li>Jumper if present Raspberry Pi will be powered from 3rd input – before putting jumper here check if connections are correct – You don’t want to burn your Pi</li>
    <li>Lets solder jumper cables here since we don’t need logic converters</li>
