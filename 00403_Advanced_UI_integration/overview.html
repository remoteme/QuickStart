<h1>Send Messages device to device</h1>
Sometimes you want to send some data into your ESP or WebPage, with RemoteMe you can do it simply using userMessages.
In this example WebPage is sending string and double value in one user message. And ESP receives message decodes it and print using serial.
Then esp  modifies recevied string and double and send it back. At the webPage you can receive these messages and see total time of communication.
<br/>
By default all user messages go through RemoteMe but by uncommenting some marked code in ESP you can turn on direct connection. With direct connection if webPage and ESP is in the same local area network all messages will be sent directly to your ESP.

<br/>
