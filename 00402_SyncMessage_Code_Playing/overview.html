<h1>Send Sync Messages</h1>

Sync messages are usefull when You want to send some data and You get some response - for example You can ask ESP give me temperature, etc. In RemoteMe to this kind of operation You can use sync messages.
In this example webPage is sneding SyncMessage to ESP or Rpi in sync messages are two double values, and as result is getting sum of this doubles. The adding oepration is executed on ESP or Rpi.
Ofcourse this usecase is trivial and useless in real life but will helps You to understand how syncMessages are working
